    "### Code Explanation: Refactored Hash Generation Script\n",
    "This script refactors the original ```create_hashes_functions.sh``` shell script into a more secure, efficient, and maintainable Python solution. It replaces external command-line tool calls with native Python libraries and functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How the Code Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Library Imports and Error Handling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: This block imports the necessary modules and gracefully handles cases where optional third-party libraries (```blake3```, ```base58```) are not installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Functionality: It uses a ```try...except ImportError``` block for each optional library. If a library isn't found, it sets the corresponding variable to ```None``` and prints a warning message. This prevents the script from crashing and allows it to run with partial functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "```generate_hashes``` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: This is the core function that generates various hashes and encodings from an input string.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input Encoding: It first converts the input string into bytes using ```.encode('utf-8')```, which is a necessary step for cryptographic hashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard Hashes: It uses Python's ```hashlib``` module to compute common hashes like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and RIPEMD160. This is significantly more efficient than calling external commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Encodings: It uses the ```base64``` module to perform Base64 encoding natively.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Optional Hashes: It checks if the ```blake3``` and ```base58``` libraries are available. If they are, it uses them to generate the hashes; otherwise, it assigns a message stating that the library is unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Return Value: The function returns a dictionary, which is a highly readable and structured way to store the key-value pairs of hash names and their results.\n",
    "\n",
    "```create_csv``` Function\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: This function safely and correctly writes the hash results to a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Workflow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Error Check: It first checks if the ```hash_results``` dictionary is empty and exits if it is, preventing an empty file from being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Header and Data Preparation: It creates a ```header``` list from the dictionary's keys and a ```data_row``` list from its values. It also adds a column for the original string.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. File Handling: It uses Python's standard ```with open(...)``` block, which ensures the file is automatically closed, even if an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CSV Module: It utilizes the ```csv``` module's ```writer``` object. This is a critical improvement over the original script's manual string concatenation, as it correctly handles commas and special characters, preventing formatting errors and data corruption.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Writing: It uses ```writer.writerow()``` to write both the header and the data row to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. User Feedback: It prints a message confirming that the file has been created.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of the Refactored Code\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhanced Security: By using native libraries and removing the dangerous ```eval``` command, the script is no longer vulnerable to command injection attacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Improved Efficiency: It avoids the overhead of creating new sub-processes for each hashing operation, resulting in faster execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Increased Portability: The script relies on standard Python libraries, making it easily executable on any system with a Python interpreter, regardless of which external command-line tools are installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Higher Maintainability: The code is more modular, readable, and easier to debug, thanks to clear function definitions, docstrings, and a structured data flow. This adheres to Python's best practices (PEP 8), making it more professional and scalable."
